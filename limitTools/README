Scripts to generate shapes and card files to use with the Higgs combine limit setting tool, 
submit the jobs to the CERN batch system and merge and plot the output.

Usage:
Execute the commands in this order as they depend on each other.

Generate shape files:
    ./makeShapeFiles.py -w myWorkDir -d MuEG -m 100 -M 2000 -S 50 -k 4.
    
    Generates shape files from input histogram in ./data/ (or specified with -i option).
    The mass points range from 100 GeV to 2000 GeV with steps of 50 GeV.
    The -k option specifies a factor for the coupling in the model.
    Use the setup for the MuEG dataset.

Generate card files:
    ./makeDataCards.py -w myWorkDir -d MuEG -m 100 -M 2000 -S 50 -k 4.
    
    Generates the card files used by the combine tool.

Submit the jobs on the batch system:
    ./launchJobs.py -q 1nd -m 100 -M 2000 -S 50 -j 10 -t 10 -T 100 -w myWorkDir
    
    This submits 10 jobs with 10 toy experiments each with 100 tries of the MCMC to the one day queue of the LSF batch system.
    
    ./launchJobs.py -q 1nd -m 100 -M 2000 -S 50 -T 100 -w myWorkDir
    
    This submits one job for each mass point with 100 tries for MCMC to calculate the observed limits.

Merge the output .root files with the limits from different toy experiments:
    ./mergeJobResults.py -w myWorkDir

Draw the cross section times branching ratio limit plot:
    ./plotLimits.py -m 100 -M 2000 -S 50 -fs -oe12t -w myWorkDir/ -k 4.
    
    This draw the final limit plot with observed (-o) and expected (-e) curves, one (-1) and two (-2) sigma band and theory (-t) curve.
    The y axis is in fb (-f) and the final plot is saved (-s) in the results subdirectory of the working directory.

Compare two limit curves:

    ./compareLimits.py -oOeE14 -w myWorkDir1/ -W myWorkDir2/ -n MuEG -N SingleMu

    Draws the limit curves from the two different working directories on one plot.
    Lower case flags select the curves to draw for directory one and uppre case flags select the curves for directory two.
    -n and -N are the names that should be displayed on the legend.
    [1-3] selects uncertainty bands for directory one and [4-6] selects bands for directory two.
    -d and -D draws markers at the calculated points.
